Gravity assist for interstellar travel

Proposal


The gravity assist is a method used to gain speed or alter the path of
a rocket or satellite using the gravity of a planet or other object.
This method was used when the Juno spacecraft used the Earth’s gravity
to begin it’s approach to Jupiter. Our project is based upon the idea
of using the method multiple times to increase the speed of a
satellite dramatically and potentially be used for interstellar
travel. We will begin by modelling the solar system and creating a
function to calculate possible slingshots to maximize velocity.
Another factor would be avoiding space debris such as asteroids.
